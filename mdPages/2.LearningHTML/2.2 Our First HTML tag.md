2. Browser will show even if with the errors exsting in the file.
   Means, browser will always show you the contents.  
   Therefore, always `becareful for the errors`.
3. Tag starts with "< >" and ends with "</ >"

### a) ul tags

makes an un-ordered list, need \<li>\</li> tags inside

### b) or tags

<br></br>

## 3) anchor tag

what ever put inside the \<a>\</a>tag will redirect you to a another url/uri
needs additional information in the **`attribute`**

> ### a) href
>
> href is short for HTTP reference OR hyper link reference
>
> ```html
> <a href="link to the page you want"></a>
> ```
>
> ### b) attributes of anchor tag
>
> href : It will take you to the written location
> target : Default is \_self  
>  \_blank is to open a new tab and go to the link from there
>
> ```html
> <a href="link to the page you want" taget="_self"></a>
> ```

- Difference with "link" tag
  <img src='images/2021-08-11-03-18-46.png' />

## 4) image tag

To append a image, \<img> should be used.
Because image is an image, it **`doesnt have a content`** between the tags.
So it is written in the **`self closing tag`** form.

```html
<img src="source location of the image" />
```

# 3. Attributes

You can set a attribute in the tag.
Anything can be written, however **`only certain tags with certain attributes`** will be inperted by the Browser.
