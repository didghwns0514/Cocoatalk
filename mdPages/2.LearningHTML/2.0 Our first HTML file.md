# 1. First step
1. Use vscode to open a top folder
2. Use **`lower case folder name`**  and  **`lower case file names`**
   - dont make files / folders starting with uppercases..  
   maybe VSCODE error? issue?

# 2. Things to remember
1. Something will show up if you type in the HTMl.
2. Browser will show even if with the errors exsting in the file.
   Means, browser will always show you the contents.  
   Therefore, always `becareful for the errors`.
3. Tag starts with "< >" and ends with "</ >"
